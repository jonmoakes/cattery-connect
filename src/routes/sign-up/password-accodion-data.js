This password is 16 characters long and uses a mix of uppercase
and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

it would take approximately 2.28 billion years to crack this
password using a brute force attack with a high-end GPU capable of
making 1 trillion guesses per second. This makes the password
extremely secure against brute force attacks.

By following these best practices, you can significantly enhance your online security and protect your personal information from unauthorised access.
